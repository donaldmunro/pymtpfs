pymtpfs is yet another FUSE filesystem for MTP devices.
It was motivated by the desire to have a more fault
tolerant file system for use when doing mass transfers
to and from MTP devices.
In my case specifically for transferring my ebooks to my
Nexus 7 using rsync as other solutions often tended to
hang half way through the transfer.
